There is also a Python program to interact with the air quality ML system using language (text, voice),
powered by a [function-calling LLM](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/function-calling-with-llms).

# Air Quality Forecast Dashboard – Lund

This dashboard shows **PM2.5 predictions for the next 7** and a **1-day-ahead hindcast** (prediction vs actual)  
for three sensors in Lund. The data is stored in Hopsworks Feature Store, the model is trained in notebook `3_air_quality_training_pipeline.ipynb`, and the plots are generated daily by `4_air_quality_batch_inference.ipynb` and a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Sensors in Lund

We predict air quality for these sensors:

- **Bankgatan**
- **Linåkersvägen**
- **Trollebergsvägen**

Each section below shows the forecast and 1-day-ahead hindcast for that sensor.

## Bankgatan

## Implementation Notes

- **Feature Store:** Weather and air-quality time series are stored in Hopsworks Feature Store.
- **Model:** The PM2.5 prediction model is trained using a feature view that includes:
  - Weather features (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.).
  - Air-quality history features.
  - **Lag features:** PM2.5 from the previous 1, 2, and 3 days.
- **Pipelines:**
  - `1_air_quality_feature_backfill.ipynb` and `2_air_quality_feature_pipeline.ipynb` populate and update the feature groups.
  - `3_air_quality_training_pipeline.ipynb` trains and registers the model.
  - `4_air_quality_batch_inference.ipynb` runs daily, reads future weather, predicts PM2.5 for the next 7–10 days for **all three Lund sensors**, writes these PNGs to `docs/air-quality/assets/img`, and commits them via GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring (hindcast):** A monitoring feature group stores daily predictions; these are joined with measured PM2.5 to produce the 1-day-ahead hindcast plots above.
